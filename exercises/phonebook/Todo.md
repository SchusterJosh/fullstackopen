## Part2d: Enhancing phonebook

**To implement:**

- [x] Create a POST request when adding a new person to save it to the backend
- [ ] Create a DELETE request to allow users to delete a person in the phonebook (can use `window.confirm()` functionality)
- [ ] Create a PUT request for updating an existing person's phone number (if the name already exists, update number)
- [ ] Extract the code that handles communication with backend into its own module
